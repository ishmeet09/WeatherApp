The WeatherApp is a user-friendly web application designed to provide up-to-date weather information for various locations. It was created using a combination of HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript to deliver a seamless and visually appealing experience for users seeking weather forecasts.

Key Features:

    Location-Based Weather: The WeatherApp allows users to input the name of a city or location in a search bar. Upon submission, it fetches real-time weather data for the specified location.

    Current Weather Display: The app displays the current weather conditions for the chosen location, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description (e.g., clear, cloudy, rainy).

    Visual Icons: To make weather information easily understandable, the app utilizes intuitive weather icons that visually represent the current conditions, such as a sun for clear weather or a cloud with raindrops for rainy weather.

    Temperature Units: Users can toggle between different temperature units (e.g., Celsius and Fahrenheit) to view the temperature in their preferred format.
